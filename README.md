# AutoClicker
AutoClicker is an Android app designed to automate repetitive tasks on your phone. With AutoClicker,
you can create macros that allow you to click on specific areas of the screen at set intervals, 
enabling you to perform tasks automatically. This can save you time and effort, especially if you 
need to perform the same action repeatedly. Whether you want to automate gaming tasks or streamline 
your workflow, AutoClicker can help you get the job done.
